# Interactive Landing Page

This is my second project for the Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree program.

The site is a landing page composed of 4 sections that contain the following main pieces of functionality:

1. The navigation bar is dynamically built in Javascript
1. Every link in the navbar smoothly scrolls to each section
1. The anchor styling automaticallly changes when transitioning between sections
1. A sticky button automatically scrolls to the top on click
1. A welcome message enters the screen from the left using Javascript animations

The site is also responsive and uses SASS to make the development process easier and more robust.
